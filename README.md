<b> Blog Application </b>

This application is a blog application that allows user to create blog, post blog posts, and comments.

This is a blog application that uses Spring boot and Angular 7.

The backend consists of a Spring Boot Application that contains the REST endpoints and repositories.
The libraries that are used are Spring Data, JPA/Hibernate, Spring Actuator, Spring AOP.

I am looking to include Spring Security sometimes later.

The front end consists of Angular 7 and Bootstrap.
The text editor I am using is https://ckeditor.com/. This is a great editor that contains a formatting toolbar that is compatible with Angular 7.

This application isn't finished just yet but this project is used to help me better understand the Angular framework.

The database I used was MYSQL. I have attached the scripts that I used under the BlogApplication.sql file.

I have added Documents folder that will contain various documents for this project.
