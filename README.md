<b> Blog Application </b>

This is a blog application that uses Spring boot and Angular 7.

The backend consists of a Spring Boot Application that contains the REST end points and repositories.
The library that are used are Spring Data, JPA/Hibernate, Spring Actuator, Spring AOP.

I am looking to include Spring Security sometimes later.

The front end consists of Angular 7, bootstrap, and some JQuery.

This application isn't finished just yet but this projects is used to help me better understand the Angular framework.
