<b> Blog Application </b>

This is a blog application that uses Spring boot and Angular 7.

This application allows users to create blog, add blog posts, and add comments to blog posts.

The backend consists of a Spring Boot Application that contains the REST endpoints and repositories.
The libraries that are used are Spring Boot Spring Data, JPA/Hibernate, Spring Actuator, Spring AOP, and Angular JS 7.

I am looking to include Spring Security sometimes later.

The front end consists of Angular 7 and Bootstrap.
The text editor I am using is https://ckeditor.com/. This is a great editor that contains a formatting toolbar that is compatible with Angular 7.

This application isn't finished just yet but this project is used in order to help me better understand the AngularJS framework.

The database I use is MYSQL. I have attached  database scripts that I used under the BlogApplication.sql file.

I have added a <b>Documents</b> folder that will contain various documents for this project.

Documents include
1.) UML Diagram
2.) Requirements
3.) Unit tests.

I will add additional documents as I worked through this project.
